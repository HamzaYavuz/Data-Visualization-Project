A. Vaccination against Covid-19 epidemic started in Turkey. People are vaccinated according to their age range. Vaccination, starting with the elderly, continues the process. Universities are still closed, although the state says it is fast. Therefore, I plan to graph the total number of vaccines administered in Turkey. However, I plan to graph the people who received the first and second dose of vaccine. Since Ankara and Istanbul are the largest cities, I plan to chart those who received the 1st and 2nd dose vaccines there.

B.I will need information about the vaccine made in Turkey, so I need information published by the ministry of health. There is no information about how much of which vaccine is used. It only gives information about how many people have been vaccinated and how many have had their first and second dose vaccinations.
While preparing the presentation, I plan to use the Covid-19 vaccine information platform, which is constantly updated by the government, and the websites where WHO publishes Turkey data. The map is provided on the Covid-19 vaccine information platform. A different route is followed on the WHO website. The information of all countries is shared, but I can access the country information you want.
